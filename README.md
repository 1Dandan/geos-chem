README


This repository contains the in-development source code for GEOS-Chem.
We are currently working on development of GEOS-Chem v11-02. All 
preliminary versions (e.g. v11-02e) are tagged. Use 'git tag' in your 
terminal to see a list of available tags. Use 'git checkout tags/tagname' 
to checkout a specific preliminary version of GEOS-Chem v11-02.

The master branch always contains the last benchmarked version. The Dev branch 
always contains in-development code for the next version to be benchmarked.
To see a list of all benchmarked versions in v11-02 thus far, and what
features are included in each, see the following wiki pages:

1. http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/GEOS-Chem_v11-02
2. http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/GEOS-Chem_v11-02_benchmark_history

Please note that an official user manual is not yet available for v11-02.
Once the v11-02 public release is benchmarked and approved a user manual
will be released and the source code will be available in the GEOS-Chem 
repository. This repository will then become the in-development source
code for v11-03.
