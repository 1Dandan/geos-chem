# GEOS-Chem Bleeding Edge #

This repository is the development repository of GEOS-Chem.  It is intended to share the latest code updates among developers.  It often contains untested and/or unbenchmarked code, so you should not use this to start a new GEOS-Chem project.  

If you want the latest publicly-released GEOS-Chem version, please see this repository:
