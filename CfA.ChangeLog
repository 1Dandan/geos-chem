07-30-14 - MSL: Clean merge of GEOS-Chem v10-01 (bleeding edge) and GIGC
	Necessary to permit using O3, OH, NO, & NO2 as individual species
	rather than as families, as done in v9-02 and prior.

07-31-14 - MSL: The clean merge includes the the following:
	   1) GEOS-Chem v10-01
	   2) HEMCO per its implementation in Ganymed4 with v9-02
	   3) all of Ganymed4/v9-02 coupling in defund "ESMF" dir
	      now moved to the "GIGC" folder
	   4) Code commented out with "!<<MSL>>" is code that likely
	      needs to be enabled (e.g. for HEMCO, etc.) but wasn't
	      necessary for the null test of this GIGC version rammed
	      back into Ganymed-4

	   The code compiles with IFORT:
	   1) The normal 'classic' GEOS-Chem make commands operate IS92a
	   2) use the 'hpc' target to compile with ESMF/MAPL & GIGC libs
	      bypassing GEOS-Chem's main.F routine.

08-22-14 - MSL: Replaced the DyCore with a working version taken from
	J. Kouatchou's GEOS-5 based CTM.s
