Files:
------
Makefile	  	-- GEOS-Chem routines that have been 
aero_drydep.f		   modified to reference the TOMAS aerosol
carbon_mod.f		   microphysics package.  These are kept
chemdr.f		   in a separate GeosTomas directory so that
chemistry_mod.f		   they do not interfere with the routines
cleanup.f		   in the GeosCore directory.
diag3.f
diag_mod.f		   The GeosTomas directory only needs to
diag_pl_mod.f		   contain the files that have been modified
drydep_mod.f		   for TOMAS.  The Makefile will look for
dust_mod.f		   all other files from the GeosCore directory
emissions_mod.f		   using the VPATH option in GNU Make.
gamap_mod.f
initialize.f		   NOTE to GEOS-Chem developers: When you 
input_mod.f		   make changes to any of these routines 
isoropia_mod.f		   in the GeosCore directory, you must also
logical_mod.f 		   make the same modifications to the
ndxx_setup.f		   corresponding routines in the GeosTomas
planeflight_mod.f  	   directory.
seasalt_mod.f
sulfate_mod.f		   Maybe in the near future we can work 
tomas_mod.f		   towards integrating TOMAS into the GeosCore
tomas_tpcore_mod.f90	   directory more cleanly.  However, due to 
tpcore_mod.f		   the large number of modifications that were
tpcore_window_mod.f	   necessary for TOMAS, it was quicker to 
tracerid_mod.f		   implement the TOMAS code in a separate
wetscav_mod.f		   subdirectory.
