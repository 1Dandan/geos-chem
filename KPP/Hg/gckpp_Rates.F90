SUBROUTINE Update_RCONST ( )




! Begin INLINED RCONST


  ! Inline an include file containing rate law definitions, which
  ! will be inserted directly into subroutine Update_Rconst().
  ! This is necessary as a workaround for KPP not being able to
  ! include very large files ( > 200000 chars) directly.
