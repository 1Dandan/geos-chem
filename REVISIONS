Changed from v5-07-05:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

calcrate.f		-- Now apply dry deposition throughout the entire PBL,
			   in order to prevent short-lived species such as 
			   HNO3 from being depleted too much in the shallow 
			   GEOS-3 surface layer
			-- Now reference PBLFRAC from "drydep_mod.f"
			-- Now declare DENAIR, CONCO2, CONCN2, T3I, TEMP1, 
			   T3K, and PRESSK as local variables, since these 
			   are only used w/in this routine and nowhere else --
			   also removed these from /DKBLOOP/ in "comode.h"

chem.f			-- Remove LSAMERAD argument, it's obsolete
			-- Add SUNCOSB to the arg list
			-- Now remove test for GETIFSUN, since FAST-J has an 
			   internal test for daytime/nighttime
			-- Pass SUNCOSB to "physproc.f"

chemdr.f		-- Now reference SUNCOSB from "dao_mod.f"
			-- Now pass SUNCOSB to "chem.f"
			-- Also remove LSAMERAD from call to CHEM,
			   since it's obsolete.

chem_h2o2		-- Now references PBLFRAC from "drydep_mod.f"  
("sulfate_mod.f")	-- Now apply dry deposition throughout the entire PBL
			-- Added FREQ variable.

chem_msa		-- Now reference PBLFRAC from "drydep_mod.f"  
("sulfate_mod.f")	-- Now apply dry deposition to the entire PBL

chem_nh3		-- Now reference PBLFRAC from "drydep_mod.f"
("sulfate_mod.f")	-- Now apply dry deposition to the entire PBL
			-- Added L and FREQ variables.
			-- Recode to avoid underflow from EXP()

chem_nh4		-- Now reference PBLFRAC from "drydep_mod.f"
("sulfate_mod.f")	-- Now apply dry deposition to the entire PBL
			-- Added L and FREQ variables.
			-- Recode to avoid underflow from EXP()

chem_nit		-- Now reference PBLFRAC from "drydep_mod.f"
("sulfate_mod.f")	-- Now apply dry deposition to the entire PBL
			-- Added L and FREQ variables.
			-- Recode to avoid underflow from EXP()

chem_so2		-- Now apply dry deposition to entire PBL
("sulfate_mod.f")	-- Now references PBLFRAC array from "drydep_mod.f

chem_so4		-- Now reference PBLFRAC from "drydep_mod.f"
("sulfate_mod.f")	-- Now apply dry deposition to the entire PBL

cleanup_drydep		-- Now deallocates PBLFRAC array
("drydep_mod.f")

comode.h		-- Split off NOCC into the /CHEM3B/ common block, 
			   since it doesn't need to be held THREADPRIVATE
			-- Removed /DKBLOOP/ and /DKBLOOP5/, since these 
			   contain variables which are used locally within
			   either "calcrate.f" or "smvgear.f"
			-- Cosmetic changes.

depvel			-- Remove the cap of surface resistance RLUXX
("drydep_mod.f")

do_drydep		-- Now make sure that the PBL depth (THIK) is greater
("drydep_mod.f")	   than or equal to than the thickness of the 1st layer
			-- Now initialize PBLFRA7C on each call 

drydep_mod.f		-- Changed MAXDEP from 15 to 16 for N2O5
			-- added PBLFRAC array

dryflx			-- Now sum drydep fluxes throughout the entire PBL  
("drydep_mod.f")	-- Added L variable
			-- AREA_CM2 has now been made into a lookup table
			-- Now implement a parallel DO loop for efficiency
	
dryflxRnPbBe		-- Now compute drydep fluxes throughout the entire PBL
("drydep_mod.f")	-- Now references PBLFRAC
			-- Added L_PBLTOP variable

init_drydep		-- Added N2O5 as a drydep tracer, w/ the same 
("drydep_mod.f")	   drydep velocity as HNO3.
			-- Now allocates PBLFRAC array

lump.f			-- Added OpenMP parallelization commands 

plsave.f		-- Added OpenMP parallelization commands 

ohsave.f		-- Added OpenMP parallelization commands

partition.f		-- Added OpenMP parallelization commands 

planeflight		-- Now references T from "dao_mod.f", so that we 
("planeflight_mod.f")	   can save out temperature for non-SMVGEAR runs. 

read_variables		-- Now locate reordered rxn numbers for SMVGEAR II
("planeflight_mod.f")

ro2_setup		-- Replace NAMESPEC w/ NAMEGAS for SMVGEAR II
("planeflight_mod.f")

smvgear.f		-- Now declare DELY, ERRHOLD, YABST, as local 
			   variables, since these are used only w/in this 
			   routine and nowhere else --- also removed these
			   from /DKBLOOP/ and /DKBLOOP5/ in "comode.h".
