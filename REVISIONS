REVISIONS (v7-04-03)  
bmy, 11 May 2006


New in v7-04-03:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

diag56_mod.f		-- Diagnostic module for lightning flash rates

is_near			-- Tests if the grid box is a near-land box (i.e.
("dao_mod.f")              if it contains at least a certain % of land and/or
	                   if one of its nearest neighbors is a land box

lightning_nox_nl_mod.f  -- Module for updated lightning NOx routines
                           using near-land formulation, as well as
			   one of CTH, MFLUX, PRECON parameterizations



Removed in v7-04-03:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Changed from v7-04-02:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cleanup.f		-- Now calls CLEANUP_DIAG56 from "diag56_mod.f" 
			   and CLEANUP_LIGHTNING_NOX_NL from 
			   "lightning_nox_nl_mod.f"

cleanup_sulfate		-- Bug fix: now deallocate PSO4_ss, PNITs 
("sulfate_mod.f")

diag3.f			-- References ND56, WRITE_DIAG56 from "diag56_mod.f" 

emissdr.f		-- NOTE: Temporary kludge: For GEOS-4 we want to use 
			   the new near-land lightning formulation.  But for 
			   the time being, we must keep the existing lightning
			   for other met field types.  This means that for
		           GEOS-4 we have to call EMLIGHTNING_NL but for
			   the other met fields we call EMLIGHTNING.

get_i6_time		-- Bug fix for GCAP: skip over Feb 29th (no leapyears)
("time_mod.f")

get_pcenter		-- Removed reference to "CMN", it's obsolete
("pressure_mod.f")

initialize.f		-- Now references ND56, ZERO_DIAG56 from "diag56_mod.f"

is_last_day_good	-- Now call ITS_A_LEAPYEAR with FORCE=.TRUE. to 
("input_mod.f")		   always return whether the year Y would be a leap
			   year, regardless of met field type.

its_a_leapyear		-- Now add FORCE argument to force ITS_A_LEAPYEAR to
("time_mod.f")		   return a value instead of just returning with FALSE
			   for the GCAP met fields

its_time_for_bpch	-- Now call ITS_A_LEAPYEAR with FORCE=.TRUE.
("main.f")		   to be compatible with GEOS or GCAP met fields

logical_mod.f		-- Added LCTH, LMFLUX, LPRECON for lightning options

main.f			-- NOTE: Temporary kludge: For GEOS-4 we want to use 
			   the new near-land lightning formulation.  But for 
			   the time being, we must keep the existing lightning
			   for other met field types.  This means that we 
			   must call LIGHTNING_NL for GEOS-4 to use the new
			   near land formulation, and call LIGHTNING for
       			   the other met field types.

read_diagnostic_menu	-- Now reference ND56, PD56, INIT_DIAG56 from 
("input_mod.f")            "diag56_mod.f"

read_emissions_menu	-- Now read LOTDLIS, LCTH, LMFLUX, LPRECON for 
("emissions_mod.f")        lightning options
			-- For now, always set LOTDLIS=T.  We have not
			   yet implemented the alternative option.

set_current_time	-- Now references "define.h"
("time_mod.f")		-- Now add special handling to skip from Feb 28th to 
			   Mar 1st for GCAP model.
